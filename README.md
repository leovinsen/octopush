# Concept

Conceptually, the game puts players into a life simulator that lasts for 7 days in real lives and at the end each player will receive a score based on how well they performed. Players can: 

- purchase and sell assets such as Mutual Funds & Bonds,
- buy an insurance policy for a rainy day,
- grow their wealth by saving their earnings in a Time Deposit,
- getting a housing or automobile loan,
- and save their earnings in a Time Deposit.

There are 14 turns in the game in which the players can perform aforementioned actions on top of responding to a unique event called a 'challenge'. Some of the challenges include:

- playing minigames to earn money,
- getting a bonus from your boss,
- and having to pay emergency hospital fees.

**Note: Many of the features are partially implemented or not implemented.**
